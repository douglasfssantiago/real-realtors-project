# Real Realtors

Welcone to the first project developed as a student in the Introduction 
to Web Development classes. The Real Estate website, is designed to provide an 
intuitive and user-friendly interface for browsing, buying, selling properties, 
and it offers the tools and resources to navigate on the real estate market 
with ease. I invite you to check out my initial project as a student. Feel free to 
get in touch.
