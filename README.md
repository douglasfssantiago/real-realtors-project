# Real Realtors

First project developed as a student in the Introduction to Web Development 
classes. The project is about a real estate website with 
basic items such as Index, About and Contact page, focusing on functionality 
and a professional design.

## About me

Hi, I'm Douglas Santiago, currently studying Software Development 
at the Manitoba Institute of Trades & Technology (MITT) in Winnipeg, Canada.

I spent 18 years working as a nurse, where I developed strong professional 
skills such as people management, teamwork, training, and the ability to 
multitask under pressure.

Transitioning to software development has been a long-time dream of mine, 
and for the past year, Iâ€™ve been dedicating myself to making this career 
change. My extensive experience in the healthcare field, combined with my 
newfound technical skills, is driving me to a great opportunity for my 
professional and personal growth.

I invite you to check out my initial projects as a student. Feel free to 
get in touch. I'm excited to discuss my qualifications and skills further 
and to contribute to future projects.
